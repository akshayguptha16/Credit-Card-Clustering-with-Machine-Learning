# Credit Card Clustering with Machine Learning

This project focuses on grouping credit card holders based on their spending behavior, credit limits, and other financial factors using machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses identify potential customer segments and design targeted marketing strategies.

## 📊 Overview

Credit card clustering, also known as credit card segmentation, involves analyzing transaction data to uncover distinct groups of customers.  
In this project, we perform **unsupervised learning** using clustering algorithms such as **K-Means** to segment customers.

## 🧠 Objective

- Understand customer behavior using key financial features  
- Apply clustering techniques to group similar customers  
- Visualize the clusters to interpret spending patterns

## 🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used contains information about credit card holders, including their spending history, credit limits, and payment patterns.  
You can download a similar dataset from online sources such as Kaggle.
